 We are performing an experiment on a data set of waveform where it has 40 attributes describing the wave form. It generates the three classes of waves and each class is generated from a combination of 2 or 3 base waves. A non-parametric method K-Nearest Neighbor is used to classify the waveform.
 
On the pdf file is a broader explanation of the soulution, and on the ipynb files is all the code we used to achieve the accurancy.
